# MAE : Mean Absoulte Error
calculate teh residual of every data points
calulate the **absolute** value
calculate the average of all residuals

# MSE : Mean Square Error
calculate teh residual of every data points
calculate teh **squared** value of residuals
Calculate the avaage of all residuals

# RMSE : Root mean square Error
calculate teh residual of every data points
calculate teh **squared** value of residuals
Calculate the avaage of the squared residuals
Obtain the **square root** of the result.

# MAPE : Mean Absolute Percentage Rerror
same as MAE and Percentage.
